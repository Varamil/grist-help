## What's new

### Spreadsheet Makeover

We like to think we‚Äôve improved many a spreadsheet here at Grist, but none more than our co-CEO Anais. Now she‚Äôs started a series where she helps those in need get a spreadsheet glow-up ‚Äì and maybe Grist factors into the solution. You‚Äôll have to watch to find out!

Anais‚Äô makeovers are a fun look at common spreadsheet pitfalls, but also a great example of why we believe so much in Grist!

### External attachment storage

![External attachment storage](../images/newsletters/2025-02/storage.png)

Previously, files in [attachment columns](https://support.getgrist.com/col-types/#attachment-columns){:target="\_blank"} exist in Grist documents as blobs (which is the technical term, by the way). Now self-hosters or those on a dedicated server Enterprise plan can host attachments externally in an S3-compatible store. 

This means that your `.grist` files can remain small even with large attachments, and that attachments have less of an impact on general and snapshot performance. More details can be found in the [Help Center](https://support.getgrist.com/document-settings/#external-attachments){:target="\_blank"}.

A huge thanks to [DINUM](https://www.numerique.gouv.fr/dinum/){:target="\_blank"} for roadmap sponsoring this feature!

### Nicer link previews

![Link previews](../images/newsletters/2025-02/preview.png)

If there‚Äôs one thing we love, it‚Äôs people sharing Grist documents. This has been made lovelier thanks to a recent PR that updates the look of shared link previews from getgrist.com. Not only does it look nice, it‚Äôs much more informative and descriptive than the previous preview, which we decline to share or remind anyone of. üëç

![grist-core release](../images/newsletters/core-release.png)

There have been *three* `grist-core` releases in the last month, but here are the notable changes present in the [most recent v1.4.2 release](https://github.com/gristlabs/grist-core/releases/tag/v1.4.2){:target="\_blank"}.

* Externally-stored attachments are now available. 
* There is a new interface for managing Enterprise subscriptions.
* In an effort to prevent certain kinds of malicious activity, there is now a limit to the number of invitations pending acceptance that a user may send.
* Added `GRIST_MAX_NEW_USER_INVITES_PER_ORG` env variable.

Full changelogs are visible on our [releases page](https://github.com/gristlabs/grist-core/releases){:target="\_blank"}. 

### Other news

* We‚Äôve officially announced the upcoming end of Python 2 support. Check out Paul‚Äôs [full post on the Community Forum](https://github.com/gristlabs/grist-core/releases){:target="\_blank"} for more details and migration tips.
* Natalie has written up an [excellent summary](https://community.getgrist.com/t/using-previous-for-cumulative-totals/8292){:target="\_blank"} of the very powerful `PREVIOUS()` function, particularly helpful with running/cumulative totals.
* We‚Äôve added a small tooltip to help describe the very cool [‚Äúview as‚Äù functionality](https://support.getgrist.com/access-rules/#view-as-another-user){:target="\_blank"} that is extremely helpful when testing access rules.
